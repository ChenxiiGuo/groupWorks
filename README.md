Declare: This project is a teamwork and I do it with [Eunchong Kim](https://github.com/EunchongKim).

## Introduction of PeliBook

This project is to develop a game for children who are younger for 13. This game will teach children how to use social medias. 

## How to use it

You could use PeliBook.jar or if you want, you could compile on your on(SceneController.java is the main class).

## Features of this software

Firstly, this project is a teamwork with others, and most(more than 90%) of the programming finished by Eunchong Kim and me.

Secondly, this project is based on JavaFx it has well-designed login system, logic system, good animation and a user interface.

Thirdly, for the login system, hash algorithms have been applied to make it safe enough(we are not twitter and we do not store users' password directly.)

Fourthly, the user interface has relatively complicated classes. However, these complicated classes make our desgin very simple.
